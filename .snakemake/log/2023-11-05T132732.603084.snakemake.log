MissingOutputException in rule call_trgt in file /nfs/turbo/dcmb-class/bioinf593/groups/group_05/STRipe/call_trgt.smk, line 15:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/nfs/turbo/dcmb-class/bioinf593/groups/group_05/output/trgt/HG00621.hifi.sorted.vcf.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
